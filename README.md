# Methods and Models for Combinatoric Optimization - 2016
My project for the Methods and Model for Combinatoric Optimization course at Universit√† degli Studi di Padova, Master degree in Computer Science.

This project starts from a variant of a common problem in combinatoric optimization and operative reasearch: the Traveling Salesman Problem, and deploys both exact methods (based on CPLEX) and heuristics (Genetic Algorithms) to solve it.

The TSP problem in this work is based on a concrete example, which involve the path of certain types of machines deployed in factories.

Quality of heuristics is measured with reference to quality of the optimal solution, computed by CPLEX. In the context of a TSP problem the quality is given by the travelled distance, the less the better.
